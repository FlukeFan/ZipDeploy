When an ASP.NET <u>Core</u> site is running, it locks the assemblies that are in use.  This prevents the old ASP.NET style x-copy deployment.

ZipDeploy is a small library to allow you to zip up your publish folder and deploy it by FTP-ing the resulting zip up to a running site.  This can prevent errors like ERROR_FILE_IN_USE, or "locked by an external process":
